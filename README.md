# RESTful API using Django Rest Framework

## Introduction
A simple RESTful API built in [Django Rest Framework(DRF)](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) using Django DB Models and DRF's Model View Set.

A sqlite3 database named "students.sqlite3" is included in the repository with some sample data for testing.

## Running the app
Go the the directory where manage.py is and run the following command from terminal

```
python manage.py runserver
```
It will run the server at localhost:8000/ by default.



###N. B: You can install django and django-rest-framework using 

```
pip install django djangorestframework
```

If pip can't install the packages due to access denied issue, try with sudo and it's always better to run the project from virtual environment.
